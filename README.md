## For Whom?

Organisations and public services, local and international, who want to make a difference and have a positive impact on our world and need help 



## Who can get involved?

Data scientists, developers and everyone with an idea aiming to collaborate on projects that have a positive impact on society and the environment!


## Who runs D4G?

The community does! Anybody who wants to contribute to making D4G better is **highly** encouraged to do so! Everything in D4G thus far has come from grassroots ideas proposed and pushed forward by a community member just like you and there's always more room for improvement. Whether it's starting a new project or proposing a new tool for the community to use, don't hesitate to just go for it!

## Across the Community

While most of our work will be project based, we're looking for common needs across projects that the organization can support. These are ongoing roles that can be time consuming, but are also essential to making the community helpful to our partners and a valuable experience for our volunteers.

### Project Leads
There are a few people in every active project keeping the group on track, taking questions, and helping new folks get settled in -- that's by design. Leading a project can be a big time commitment, but it's hugely valuable to making sure we're doing useful work, and volunteers are getting the most out of volunteering. You don't need to be super technical, just organized and enthusiastic!

### Storytelling
Our projects will be doing some interesting data gathering and analysis that we hope to share with the world

### Infrastructure and IT administration
We're doing this on a per-project basis, along with building tools for data science collaboration, and always need help.

### Matchmaker
We could use more people who know about the various projects that are happening along with the skills of the incoming volunteers, and can both match people to projects (ideally, to specific tasks), along with routinely surfacing new opportunities to the broader community for folks to get involved at all skill levels.



## Project Ideas
