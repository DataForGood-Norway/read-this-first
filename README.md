## For Whom?

Organisations and public services, local and international, who want to be an agent for positive change in our world and need help finding and implementing technical tools and solutions to pressing issues. 



## Who can get involved?

Data scientists, developers and everyone with an idea aiming to collaborate on projects that have a positive impact on society and the environment!


## Who runs D4G?

The community does! Anybody who wants to contribute to making D4G better is **highly** encouraged to do so! Everything in D4G thus far has come from grassroots ideas proposed and pushed forward by a community member just like you and there's always more room for improvement. Whether it's starting a new project or proposing a new tool for the community to use, don't hesitate to just go for it!



## Getting Started  

* We use Slack and GitHub as our primary means of organization and communication. Email join [at] dataforgood.no for an invite to the team.  
* If you see a project you are interested in, join the project Slack channel, introduce yourself to the community and the project lead(s).  
* Visit project readme for specific instructions on who to contact or how to get started.
* Have an idea for a new project? Join [#project-ideas](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/project-ideas/issues) to start a discussion on a new project.
* Looking for a certain type of task in any project? Check the [task digest](#task-digest).

## Across the Community

While most of our work will be project-based, we have some roles that take care of common needs and help the community to focus on project work itself. These roles can be time-consuming, but are also essential to making the community useful and a valuable experience for our volunteers. Have a look at [the roles repo in this organization](https://github.com/DataForGood-Norway/roles).
